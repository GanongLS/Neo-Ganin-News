# Neo Ganin News Web App Blueprint for Rust Training

This Repo is just a copy of Fork https://github.com/rust10x/rust-web-app

The last Commit I sync from Jeremy around 2024 February 07.

I intend to continue from the main branch from the last commit on main branch of Jeremy repo at 2024 February 07. 

This repository aims to be a place for me(ganLS) to practice Rust. The end goal is to create a Web Server for the Web for News provider (think of it like Time).

Thank You.
